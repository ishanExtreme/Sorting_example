# Problem Statement

Given a large list of integers, sort the list into ascending order

input->
size of array(0 to 10,000)
elements of array one after the other
size of each elements are in range 0 to 20,000

output->
original array
and
sorted array

We at our best tried to implement this but our worst case time complexity is ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(n^2)),
and need your help to make our sorting faster.
